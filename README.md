# Coordinating & Engineering a Realistic Phishing Simulation Event | The PhishTrap.
#### Proud to have successfully led "PhishTrap", an immersive phishing simulation challenge where participants took on the role of adversaries to ethically breach human-layer defenses through advanced phishing tactics and social engineering techniques.

### This initiative was conceptualized, designed, and executed with the collaborative support of : 
- B. Sree Divya – Senior Advisor & Event Coordinator 
- Kanne Karthik – Peer Lead, OSINT Strategist & Profile Architect. 

## 💡 Institutional Backing:
 A special note of gratitude to our Faculty Coordinators, Lab Incharges, and Malla Reddy University - Department of Cyber Security & IoT for championing this unique cybersecurity initiative and entrusting us with the opportunity to coordinate and execute such a technically demanding event.

## 🛠️ My Role: 
Building the Phishing Simulation Infrastructure
I built the entire phishing simulation environment from scratch using Kali Linux CLI, Python, Flask which significantly strengthened my technical skills in CLI-based orchestration, phishing simulation design, and secure service deployment.

## 🔧 Ecosystem & Tools Setup:
Mailhog – Controlled phishing mail distribution with real-time mail logging.
Ngrok – Secure tunneling for exposing local phishing portals to the web.
Apache2 – Hosting lookalike phishing sites and static payload pages.
Custom Scripts – Traffic logging, spoof simulations, and attacker-side logic.
#### This environment allowed a sandboxed, controlled-yet-realistic platform for participants to simulate spear-phishing scenarios in a dynamic multi-target ecosystem.

## 🎯 Participant Objectives: Participants had to:
 ✅ Perform deep OSINT on pre-built persona-based targets
 ✅ Craft personalized phishing emails with strategic social engineering
 ✅ Deploy lookalike portals using spoofing methods and mimic tactics
 ✅ Employ deception methods (spoofed sender, fake document names, cloaked URLs)
 ✅ Understand and leverage target psychology to ethically trick victims
 ✅ Log captured data and document impact trails for analysis
#### This wasn’t a plug-and-play task — this was a realistic phishing simulation, challenging participants to build trust, deceive, and ethically infiltrate systems using authentic phishing tactics.

## 🎓 My Takeaways as Student Coordinator:
Creative Narration of targets and story building.
Building multi-user, multi-target phishing ecosystems.
Behavioral logic mapping for phishing narratives.
Coordinating team logistics + real-time evaluation during live sessions.
Creating controlled phishing attack surfaces using best practices.

## 🏆 Applause to the Winners:
Kudos to the Winners — Rupa Karedla & B. Sree Navya — your OSINT creativity, crafted narratives, and behavioral attacks were exceptional! Your submissions reflected maturity, ethical creativity, and strategic execution.
